### Note
If you haven't already downloaded a service account key from Firebase for the scripts folder. Go follow the scripts README first then come back here.
Once you're done with that, copy and paste the credentials.json file from the scripts folder into this folder (functions) and name it service-account.json

Follow the instructions on the main readme for initializing a firebase project into a local folder (a different folder)
